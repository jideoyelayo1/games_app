# Mobile Development Practice Repository

Welcome to my mobile development practice repository! This repository is dedicated to honing my skills in mobile app development using Flutter and Dart. Here, I'll be building various apps and games, all bundled into a single app, allowing seamless navigation between them. This project serves as an opportunity for me to practice and improve my skills in Dart, Flutter, Android Studio, Git, and more.

## Apps and Games

Here's an overview of the apps and games I have planned for this repository:

1. **Hangman**: The classic word-guessing game. This app is already completed, providing a great starting point to understand my coding style and project structure.

2. **Snake**: A recreation of the timeless Snake game. I'm currently working on this app and looking forward to implementing intuitive controls and challenging gameplay.

3. **Flappy Bird**: An adaptation of the popular Flappy Bird game. I haven't started this app yet, but I'm excited to tackle the game mechanics and design engaging visuals.

4. **Cookie Clicker**: A clicker/idle game where players click on cookies to earn points and unlock upgrades. This app is still in the planning stage, but I aim to create addictive gameplay mechanics and visually appealing UI.

5. **GPS-based App**: An app that utilizes the device's GPS capabilities. Although I haven't begun development on this app, I plan to leverage location services to provide useful features, such as geolocation-based reminders or navigation.

6. **Camera-based App**: An app that integrates the device's camera functionality. While I haven't started this project yet, I aim to explore camera APIs to build features like image capture, photo filters, or augmented reality experiences.

And more exciting projects to come!

## Repository Structure

To maintain an organized codebase, I've structured the repository as follows:

- `hangman/`: Contains the completed Hangman app.
- `snake/`: Work in progress on the Snake game.
- `flappy_bird/`: Placeholder for the Flappy Bird game.
- `cookie_clicker/`: Placeholder for the Cookie Clicker game.
- `gps_app/`: Placeholder for the GPS-based app.
- `camera_app/`: Placeholder for the Camera-based app.
